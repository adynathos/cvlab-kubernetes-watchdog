		<h2 id="resource-allocation-in-cvlab">CVLab Kubernetes Queue</h2>
		<p>More information in the <a href="https://gitlab.com/Adynathos/cvlab-kubernetes-guide">CVLab Kubernetes Guide</a>.</p>
		<p>We want to ensure that everyone can use at least one GPU.
		We order the jobs and the position in the queue will decide which jobs will be allowed to run in case we have more requests than available resources.</p>
		<ul>
		<li>A job using one person's 1st GPU has precedence over any person's 2nd GPU job. A 2nd GPU job is above any 3rd GPU job and so on.</li>
		<li>Among the jobs of a single user, we order them according to user-set priority (in the label <code>priority</code>) with higher numbers being more important: priority <code>+1</code> is before priority <code>-1</code>, the default is 0.
		</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you're looking to allocate a new pod with higher rank than some already in the queue, and it does not allocate due to lack of resources (stays <code>Pending</code> or is rejected because of the quota),
		you should kill the lowest priority pod (bottom of the table). 
		You do not have to notify the owner, as it was before.
		</p>
		<p>
		For example, if you are getting your 1st GPU, you can kill whatever is on the bottom of the table, as long as its someone's 2nd or higher GPU.
		</p>
		<p>Please remember to specify your user name and priority in the pod config.</p>
		<pre>
metadata:
  name: username-example-test
  labels:
    user: your-username
    priority: "1" # job with higher priority number takes precedence
		</pre>

		<h3>Preventing empty pods</h3>
		<p><code>sleep infinity</code> (or anything above 8h) is not a welcome specification for your pod, as these pods get forgotten and cause unnecessary costs for the lab.
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
			If you're debugging, 8h will definitely be sufficient for a day's session, especially as you can resubmit such a pod once it expires.
			If you want to run multiple jobs and debug at the same time, consider joining forces with some other lab member: perhaps the already have a debug pod allocated and you can share it without the risk of someone killing your debugging instance due to its low rank.
			</li>
			<li>
			If you use Jupyter notebooks, please run them with timeout, for example:
			<pre>timeout 4h jupyter lab --ip=0.0.0.0 --no-browser --notebook-dir=/cvlabdata2/home/lis/kubernetes_example"</pre>
			</li>
			<li>
			If you're looking to execute multiple programs on the same pod (GPU), please use the adaptive sleeper.
			It terminates half an hour after there is no activity on the GPU, CPU and there is no python process. Use the following command:
			<pre>python /cvlabdata2/sleeper/sleeper</pre>
			This script needs the following libraries:
			<pre>pip install psutil py3nvml</pre>
			</li>
			<li>
			If a <code>sleep infinity</code> pod is spotted idle (as evidenced by the GPU usage column on the table), any lab member can kill such a pod at will.
			</li>
			<li>
			In all other cases, and the general preferable solution, is to submit a script that runs your experiments and then exits in finite time (such as <code>python my_experiment.py</code>). This way we use (and pay for) exactly as much compute time as necessary.
			</li>
		</ul>
	<p>
	We're aware that those rules are an imperfect approximation of what a proper job scheduler should do. We're looking into deploying a more reliable and less manual solution such as <a href="https://volcano.sh/">https://volcano.sh/</a>. If you would like to have any input or help us with that endeavor, please come and talk to us.
